# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis
This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns using various metrics such as ROI, customer engagement, and sales impact. Below are the steps I followed to achieve the objectives of this project.

**Steps Followed**
**Data Importation:**
Imported the dataset from Kaggle, which includes various columns related to customer information, campaign responses, and purchasing behavior.

**Data Cleaning and Manipulation:**
Used Power Query Editor in Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and manipulation:
Removed null values to ensure data integrity.
Transformed data types to appropriate formats (e.g., date columns).
Handled missing values and outliers.

**Data Preparation:**
Created new columns and metrics to aid in analysis:
Calculated the total number of offers accepted across all campaigns.
Generated aggregate metrics for customer purchases and engagement.

**Data Analysis:**
_Analyzed the data to extract key insights:_

Calculated overall response rate:
Overall Response Rate = (Total Accepted Offers / Total Number of Offers Made) * 100

Calculated total revenue and total cost:
Total Revenue = SUM(RevenueColumn)
Total Cost = SUM(CostColumn)

Calculated ROI:
ROI = ((Total Revenue - Total Cost) / Total Cost) * 100

**Data Visualization:**

Created a comprehensive dashboard to visualize the findings:
Visualized KPIs such as total investment, total revenue, profit, ROI, and average purchase.
Used various charts (bar charts, pie charts, line charts) to represent customer engagement and sales impact.
